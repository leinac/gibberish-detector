**Task:- 
To create a gibberish detector which can classify the given queries which has been shared in the dataset and also to create a Flask API on this. The data consist two columns text and label. Where Label==1 means gibberish. 

1. Gibberish detector model:- You can use anything which you want just donâ€™t use pretrained models. We will evaluate you on the steps you followed for completing the task
2. Flask Api:- In this api you have to create a POST request in which you will be sending the text form body and giving a response gibberish true or false.

**Files Need to be shared:-
1. Postman Collection for API
2. Confusion Matrix for test data (Create a test split from the data which has been shared)
3. A python file which can load a csv with one column containing text and run your model or pipeline and gives the output for each row.
4. Last thing Flask API code and requirement file for environment.

**gibberish_detector.ipynb---> Has workaround code 

***Created Folders for Saved Models as well to maintain directory structure and code clean..

** Note:- Create Folders for each file with label as 1,2,3,4 and zip the whole content in it.
